## About

This was a project used to study Next.js.

In it I created a catalog of marvel heroes.

The goal was to create a catalog with information that doesn't change often.

Next.js was perfect for this job, because with it I was able to set a time of 20 seconds to revalidate the static information, but it could be 2 hours, 2 days, etc...

## Runing

`yarn api` to raise our api

`yarn build` to build the project

`yarn start` to run the project emulating a production environment
